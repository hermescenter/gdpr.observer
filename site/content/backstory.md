## In Italy MonitoraPA project demonstrated successfully how to lead to data protection improvements (e.g. remove massively google analytics, google fonts, etc) by automating detection of illegal transfer of data to GAFAM and automatically reporting/notifying via email to the website owners. More than 90.000 report emails has been sent over multiple "detection" campaigns sparkling hundreds of articles, conferences, webminar due to the massive natures of data violation reporting. Extremely positive outcome of removal of data transfer and GDPR compliance has been obtained, in a measurable and repeatable way. Many other new services are being included in the automated analysys/reporting system: https://monitora-pa.it/2022/11/30/MonitoraPA_results.html
