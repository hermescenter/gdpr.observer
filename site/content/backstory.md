## In Italy, since spring 2022, the Monitora-PA project has been launched.

## Focuses on public institution sites; analyzes trackers, cookies, and other information that can be inferred in an automated way. If it finds violations, it notifies DPOs of the problem.

## It caused a massive decrease of google-analytics, google-fonts, and anything else inappropriate under GDPR on websites paid with public money, access to which is unavoidable for needy citizens, they have no alternative to enjoy the same services.

## Starting with 22 thousand sites, more than 90,000 e-mail reports were sent out over the course of multiple detection campaigns. We did not work on a campaign, because the volume and amazement of these emails raised enough confrontation to bring the presence of trackers down by 90 percent across the entire pool of public agency sites. An extremely positive result of data transfer removal and GDPR compliance has been achieved in a measurable and repeatable way.

#### Because Monitora PA success was so effective in Italy, we:
1. Want to replicate the same success in other European Member State, exception made for Italy, where we leave Monitora PA continuing its activity
2. We want no abstract and separate the technical effort from the national-level activism necessary to get results.
