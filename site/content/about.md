### GDPR observer is a project started and maintained by the [Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights](https://hermescenter.org). It depends heavily on partnership to exists, and our goal is to host contributions from other developers and team.

### It is originally inspired by the success of [Monitora PA](https://monitora-pa.it) an italian experiment that in 6 months caused a drastic reduction of US-based third party trackers in all the public agencies websites, and now we want to make it scale up european wide.
