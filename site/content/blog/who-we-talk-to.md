## In each member state (except Italy) we need one or more referrers.

These referents can be organizations or individuals.

The purpose of these referents is to provide for a list of institutional sites. every site paid for with public money should go on that list.

We also need the list of data protection officers for each of those sites. This is a job that can be solved in three ways:

1. patience
2. automation
3. knowledge. sometimes official lists exist, but only referring nations may know.

This is work that requires perseverance over time, knowledge of the language, and in the later stages interactions with Data Protection Officers and Data Protection Authorities.
