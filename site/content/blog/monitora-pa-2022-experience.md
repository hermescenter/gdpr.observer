In less than 1 year, more than 90% of the institutional website that were using Google Analytics, **removed it from their pages**. _This apply also to other Google services._

#### The `Monitora-PA` pipeline

1. Download a database of public agencies names along with website address and contact email address of the DPO.
2. Analyze each website and search for google-analytics. Produce a short report and open data.
3. Filter the dataset from point 1, keep only the organizations/websites/emails that match the analysis of point 2.
4. Send a notification email to the DPO with a predefined template.
5. Measure and publish removal rate % each month.
6. Repeat from point 2.

#### This was also possible because of two specific italian perks

* Exists a national list of all the institutions, with website and DPO mail address, maintained by AgID.
* Exists an email compatible protocol that bound a public official to consider the content of the email (PEC). This has been used to send notifications.

#### After two months
