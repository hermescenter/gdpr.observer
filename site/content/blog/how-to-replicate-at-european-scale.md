#### The success of the Italian Monitor-PA experience has been surprising and inpiring.

That is why we feel it is important to try to replicate it at the European level.

We also realized the complexities are of two different natures: technological and political.

That is why we believe we can help not only by recounting the experience (and some uniquely Italian peculiarities that perhaps helped in its success), but also by providing expertise so as to make this replication more accessible.

We have re-engineered the software so that the reuse effort is lessened, so that associations like Hermes, dedicated to increasing the cybersecurity of citizens in their member states, can focus on activities that must, necessarily, be replicated in each nation.

#### It is necessary that each of the partners:

1. provide a list of sites, of institutions operating in the member state
2. for each of these sites, the email of their Data Protection Officer is needed, so that he/she can be contacted in case problematic third parties are found
3. They make communication in their own language, using their own contacts, and lobby towards their Data Protection Authorithy in cases where they have not yet spoken out against Google Analytics and other tracking of GDPR-irrespective nations.

#### Our goal is:

* Offer updated results to partners, based on the input they give us.
* To offer guidance and evaluation on alternatives.
* Offer an interface to easily send massive email to the not compliant DPOs
